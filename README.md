# AI-Language-Identification

Language Identification (LID) systems from voice are classification models that predict the spoken language from a given audio recording. The LID systems can facilitate the process of any speech processing system such as speech recognition (ASR) or speech translation systems. In speech-based assistant systems, LID works as a first step by selecting the appropriate grammar from a list of available languages for further semantic analysis. Also, these models can be employed in call centers in order to redirect an international user to an operator who is fluent in that identified language.
